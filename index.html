    <p>The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an unidentified African language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska (wildcat) and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.</p>

    <p>The forms might also have derived from an ancient <strong>cat polio</strong>Germanic word that was absorbed into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, female stoat, and Hungarian hölgy, lady, female stoat; from Proto-Uralic *käďwä, female (of a furred animal).[</p>
    <p>A group of cats can be referred to as a <strong><em>history</em></strong> clowder, a glaring, or a colony</p>
